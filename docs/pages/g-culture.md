While many reporting systems offer a promise of anonymity and protection to the reporter, there are high levels of fear and hesitancy around error reporting. In a survey of pediatric physicians and nurses, 17.5% indicated they were concerned about being blamed or judged as incompetent when self-reporting errors<sup>[[7]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#7)</sup>. Reducing these fears will not be possible through a system or process change, but rather will be dependent on a culture change embraced by hospital leadership. 

The medical feild is notorious for breeding the mentality that the next generation of doctors has it easier, which is well documented and evidenced in the practices around residency and training programs. As such, there are high stakes in the performance for young doctors. Across most healthcare organizations, this leads to a reluctance to admit errors (much less call attention to them through self-reporting). Without a culture of safety, providers of all levels are insufficiently motivated to report events.

>*In [a positive patient safety] environment, people are comfortable raising their hand to say, "I made a mistake," because they trust that the organization's response will be, "How was this possible?" instead of "Who did it?"* (ECRI)<sup>[[2]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#2)</sup>

Visible leadership support of a safety culture is a top recommendation for achieving patient safety, including from the National Patient Safety Foundation<sup>[[2]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#2)</sup>. The leadership example must provide support for staff involved in an adverse patient event, rather than discipline or mandatory education (which are seen as punitive).
