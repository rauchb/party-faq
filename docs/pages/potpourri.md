### What should I wear?
Whatever you'd like! I'll be in jeans. Use this as an event to dress up for if you'd like, or come in sweatpants. 

### An 8 hour party... isn't that excessive?
(Yes, and...) It's an open house. Come at any point during the day. If you're local, come and go as you'd like. In general, I'm expecting families to join for the early afternoon and adults to stay into the evening. Children present after 6pm may receive Jell-O shots. 

### Is lodging available?
There are some beds and couches available in my house and the houses of my wonderful friends also in this neighborhood. Let me know if you'll need a space. 

### Don't you have school work to be doing instead of making an FAQ page for your party?
Yes, yes I do.
