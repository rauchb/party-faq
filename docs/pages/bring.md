### Can I contribute food, dessert, or beverages?
Two meals from local Philly establishments will be available throughout the day: Ricci's italian subs (aka hoagies) for lunch and Mission Tacqueria for dinner. If you have specific dietary restrictions, please bring some food that you can enjoy!

Desserts and assorted beverages will also be prepared to meet guests' needs and wants. Please don't go out of your way to find something to bring. However, if you have a favorite recipe that you're looking for an excuse to make, or know of a local beer that you think I'd like, then these contributions would be welcome.

### Should I bring my human children?
If you'd like to! There will be Legos and Disney movies available in the basement. 

### Should I bring fur children?
While pets are usually very welcome in this house, due to the high demand, this event will be limited to human attendees. 

### What about gifts?
Gifts are not required nor requested. Your presence is all I neeam looking for (really). For those of you who refuse to accept this fact, and Amazon wish list will be available to peruse soon.
