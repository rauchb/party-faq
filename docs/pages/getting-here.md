### When should I arrive?
Whenever you'd like - pick a time that works for your schedule. Families are encouraged to join early in the day. 

### What's the best way to get to your house?
However google tells you to get here. I am pretty much in the center of the area bordered by I-95, I-76, and I-676. There is no right way to do it. 

### Where should I park?
Street parking is available all around the house. The signage varies block by block, so check the nearest sign before heading to the house. Most streets will be *"2 hour parking except with permit"*. I will have Zone 1 permit day passes available to put in your car. 

Free parking (meaning you won't need to make a trip back to your car to put the pass on your windshied) is available on the following blocks:
- On 16th between Washington and Carpenter
- Three spots on Carpenter between 18th and Bouvier (right side only)
- On Carpenter between 17th and 16th
- On Carpenter between 16th and 15th (right side only)
- On 18th between Catherine and Fitzwater

Be sure to never park in front of a driveway, crosswalk, or fire hydrant. 

If you'd prefer to park in a garage, the [Lincoln Square Parking](https://goo.gl/maps/FptYUGYSjrYTDUPo7) garage is accessible from 15th Street between Washington and Carpenter. It is about an eight minute walk to my house from there. Weekend rate is $12 for the day.
