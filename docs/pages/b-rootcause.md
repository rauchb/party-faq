There are a growing number of studies that examine the barriers to reporting medical errors. The most commonly cited causes of underreporting are captured below.

### Measurement
A survey of the reasons nurses and physicians do not report all medical errors found that 40.7% are unsure what is considered a medical error<sup>[[7]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#7)</sup>. This indicates a lack of clear definitions, a prerequisit for any valid measurement or data collection. 

### People
For effective error reporting, all levels of hospital employees must be involved. Nurses are the most likely to report errors, but cannot solely carry the responsibility. Physicians must be well trained and involved in the reporting process. In addition, hospital leadership must generate a culture that is focused on patient safety as the primary priority. 

### Environment
Commonly, the system for reporting errors involves (or has the perception of involving) disciplinary action for the individual who reported the event or a peer of that indivdual who may be held responsible. Of survey responders, 37.0% are concerned about implicating others<sup>[[7]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#7)</sup>. Hospital staff reported that this environment makes submitting error reports feels like "tattling" on their coworkers and team members<sup>[[1]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#1)</sup>. There is also a fear of retaliation or legal action<sup>[[6]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#6)</sup>. The culture around patient safety and error reporting must be non-punative and committed to action in response to reports.

Many studies have found that providers don't unerstand the importance or reporting, particularly for events that did not reach the patient. This sentiment increases in nurses with more than five years' experience, with 52.5% reporting they beleived there was no point in reporting near misses<sup>[[2]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#2),[[3]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#3)</sup>. 

### Materials
In one study, 15.7% of staff found the incident report form too complicated<sup>[[7]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#7)</sup>. Improving the ease of event submission has been found to increase the quantity of events reported<sup>[[5]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#7)</sup>. An expedited reporting system would alleviate the barrier of conflicting priorities as well. Nurses and physicians with heavy patient care demands very rarely have dedicated time to report errors. Even an individual with a strong belief in the importance of reporting will have to compete against daily required tasks.

### Methods (Process)
In systems without transparency or without clear policies, there may be confusion about whose responsibility it is to report a medical error. The belief that someone else has reported the event is a common cause for an individual not reporting themselves<sup>[[2]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#2)</sup>. Physicians, especially, commonly express that they don't believe error reporting is a primary function of their job as medical providers. 

### Equipment
Finally, a dedicated space to error reporting removes an equipment barrier.
