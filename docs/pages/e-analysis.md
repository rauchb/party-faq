To break the cycle of underreporting, hospitals need to foster a just culture, streamline the reporting process, decrease the time required to complete a reports and develop essential feedback loops when system failures are reported.

Improvement efforts with the number of safety events reported as primary outcome measure have been shown to be effective<sup>[[5]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#5)</sup>. However, it is not necessary to rely exclusively on reporting. Voluntary error reporting can be supplemented with triggers for chart review, observation, and integrated proactive quality improvement (QI) programs. 

Reporting alone will not improve patient safety. Data collected must lead to the implementation of changes to the care systems. Once the volume of error reports increases, a focus on root cause analysis, improvement, and outcome transparancy is necessary.

Interventions to improve underreporting should be focused in three areas:

- [Just Culture](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/pages/analysis/culture/)
