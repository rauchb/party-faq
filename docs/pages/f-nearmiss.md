A **near miss** is defined in the Joint Commissionâ€™s sentinel event program as _events that did not have a significant outcome but might have if the situation had been repeated_. Similarly, a "good catch" is a related term used to describe events caught before they harmed the patient<sup>[[1]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#1)</sup>.

A survey revealed that 22.2% of nurses and physicians do not feel it is important to report error that did not reach the patient, and 13.9% do not feel it is important to report error that did not harm the patient<sup>[[7]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#7)</sup>. There is a clear disconnect between the benefits of reporting near miss events and the perceived benefits from the perspective of medical staff. This incongruency must be addressed through leadership engagement and provider education.

Reducing risk exposures due to underreporting medical errors is best addressed by improving the reporting of the events that do not reach the patient. Near misses provide greater opportunity than adverse event reporting. First, this is an ideal area to target for QI interventions, since the fear of blame or retribution is reduced in the absence of patient harm. Secondly, good catches can inform gaps in the patient care systems prior to events occuring. Following this, root cause analysis can bring to light **latent errors**. Once gaps in the system are identified, PDSA cycles can be implemented to fix these systems - all before patient harm occurs.
