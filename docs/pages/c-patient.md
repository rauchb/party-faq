The risks of underreported errors are most clearly evident from the patient perspective. Many healthcare organizations utilize error-based patient safety metrics, such as an error rate of identified errors divided by the potential opportunities for that error to occur<sup>[[6]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#6)</sup>. With an incomplete dataset due to underreporting, these patient safety metrics are falsely inflated.

A positive safety culture has been linked in a variety of studies to reduced infection rates, fewer admissions, better surgical outcomes, reduced adverse events, and decreased mortality<sup>[[2]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#2)</sup>. Thus, a punitive culture or one where errors are kept hidden would result in the opposite effect - increasing these undesirable patient outcomes. 

Safety events that are reported are often subject to hindsight bias in the attribution of the primary cause<sup>[[6]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#6)</sup>. This may lead to simplifying the systemâ€™s flaws and prevent only the same adverse event in the future.

In addition to the prevention of system improvements, underreporting at an individual level can impact that patient's clinical outcomes within or after their hospital admission. When there is an error involved in a patient's care that is not reported or added to the chart (perhaps because an in-the-moment review indicated there was no harm), there may be latent effects that will impact outcomes or recovery. 

Ultimately, underreporting has a direct impact on patient outcomes and masks these impacts through inaccurate and incomplete tracking of patient safety.
