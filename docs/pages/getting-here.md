Medical errors are estimated to be the eighth leading cause of death in the United States, with the Institute of Medicine (IOM) estimating up to 98,000 deaths annually from this single cause <sup>[[7]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#7)</sup>. Errors that lead to adverse events, such as patient harm, are **preventable medical errors**. Underreporting of preventable medical errors has been estimated between 50% and 96% annually.
> An error is *the failure of a planned action to be carried out as intended or the use of a wrong plan to achieve an aim* - Institute of Medicine<sup>[[8]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#8)</sup> 

There is significant underreporting of medical errors, but the severity and rate of underreporting is largely unknown. In one study at Childrenâ€™s Hospital and Regional Medical Center in Seattle, Washington, 45.9% of physicians and 10.5% of nurses reported zero incidents (combined errors and near misses) in the last 12 months. In addition, 40.8% of providers responding to this survey indicated that _less than half_ of errors they committed were reported<sup>[[7]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#7)</sup>. Similarly, New York state hospitals compared 176 voluntarily self-reported sentinel events to 11,028 reports collected through the NYPORTS system<sup>[[4]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#4)</sup>.

Preventing medical errors requires an accurate collection of data on the occurrence, frequency, types, and outcomes of medical errors. The most prevalent form of data collection for this information is incident reporting, which requires both **identification** of the error and action of **reporting**. Underreporting can occur when either of these steps fail.

The emphasis on patient safety in recent decades brings risk management to the forefront of clinical care. This provides the opportunity for preventative measures, rather than the traditional post-event approach where change and interventions are driven by litigation. 

Error reduction efforts require data on the occurrence of errors, and underreporting provides an incomplete dataset<sup>[[8]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#8)</sup>. Dependable patient safety outcomes require a just culture, open reporting systems, and teamwork and communication across multiple disciplines<sup>[[1]](https://rauchb.github.io/RMI-5103/assets/sources/#1)</sup>.
